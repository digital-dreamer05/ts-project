## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to my TypeScript learning project! This repository represents my journey in mastering TypeScript by building a practical Express.js application.

> **⚠️ Note:** This is a **practice/learning project**, not a production-ready application. It's designed to explore TypeScript's features and best practices in a Node.js/Express environment.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

- ✨ Understanding TypeScript fundamentals
- 🔧 Integrating TypeScript with Express.js
- 📦 Working with type definitions and interfaces
- 🏗️ Structuring a TypeScript backend project
- 🔍 Implementing type-safe controllers and models
- 🛠️ Configuring build tools and development workflow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Main programming language
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **pnpm** - Package manager
